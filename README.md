# vue-masonry-wall
A pure vue masonry project without direct dom manipulation and ssr friendly. 
I created this because [vue-masonry](https://github.com/shershen08/vue-masonry) has no SSR support and I needed a pure vue implementation. 

## DEMO

## Features 
- No Direct DOM Manipulation
- SSR Support

## Usage
### Basic 

### SSR

## Installation
NPM
```
npm i vue-masonry-wall
```

Yarn
```
yarn add vue-masonry-wall
```

## Dependencies
- [vue-observe-visibility](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-observe-visibility) = [IntersectionObserver](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/master/polyfill)
- [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash)  

## Features from my original project removed for brevity of the package
- [nuxt-community/device-module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/device-module) to detect browser for better SSR support.
- [vue-scrollto](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-scrollto) to scroll to a item in masonry.
